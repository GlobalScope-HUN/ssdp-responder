.Sh DESCRIPTION
Simple Service Discovery Protocol daemon (SSDP) for networked Linux
devices.  Useful for small and embedded systems that want to announce
themselves to UPnP capable systems, e.g. Windows.
.Pp
.Nm
is a stand-alone UNIX daemon with no external dependencies but the
standard C library.  It has a built-in web server for serving the UPnP
XML description which Windows use to present the icon, by default an
InternetGatewayDevice is announced.
.Pp
.Nm
reads
.Pa /etc/lsb-release
to determine the distribution name and version, which along with the
system hostname, is periodically transmitted in SSDP multicast discovery
frames.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width "-r SEC " -compact
.It Fl d
Developer debug mode
.It Fl h
Show program help text
.It Fl i Ar SEC
SSDP notify interval (30-900), default 300 sec
.It Fl n
Run in foreground, do not daemonize by default
.It Fl r Ar SEC
Interface refresh interval (5-1800), default 600 sec
.It Fl t Ar TTL
TTL for multicast frames, default 2, according to the UPnP Device
Architecture (UDA)
.It Fl v
Show program version
.It Ar IFACE
By default
.Nm
runs on all IPv4 capable interfaces, except loopback.  If interface
names are given as arguments,
.Nm
will run only on them.  Interfaces are refrehed at runtime, so if
an interface given on the command line does not exist at first,
.Nm
will add them later.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/lib/misc/ssdpd.cache -compact
.It Pa /run/ssdpd.pid
PID file, created as soon as all setup is complete
.It Pa /etc/lsb-release
Queried for information on the distribution name (id) and release
.It Pa /var/lib/misc/ssdpd.cache
Cached value of generated UUID, may be wiped by the system on reboot

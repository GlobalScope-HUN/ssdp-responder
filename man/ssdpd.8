.Sh DESCRIPTION
Simple Service Discovery Protocol daemon (SSDP) for networked Linux
devices.  Useful for small and embedded systems that want to announce
themselves to UPnP capable systems, e.g. Windows.
.Pp
.Nm
is a stand-alone UNIX daemon with no external dependencies but the
standard C library.  It has a built-in web server for serving the UPnP
XML description which Windows use to present the icon, by default an
.Cm InternetGatewayDevice
is announced.
.Pp
On Linux systems,
.Nm
reads
.Pa /etc/os-release ,
or
.Pa /etc/lsb-release ,
in that order to determine the distribution name and version, which
along with the system hostname, is periodically transmitted in SSDP
multicast discovery frames.  If neither file exists a built-in default
is used as server string.  On non-Linux systems the information from
.Xr uname 1
is used, since that is the canonical UNIX location for such information.
.Pp
Each SSDP capable device on a LAN has its own UUID.  This is generated
the first time
.Nm
is started and stored in
.Pa /var/lib/misc/ssdpd.cache ,
on *BSD systems it is stored in
.Pa /var/db/ssdpd.cache .
Note, depending on your system this directory may be wiped on reboot, so
.Nm
may start up with a different UUID every time.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following command line options are available:
.Bl -tag -width "-l LEVEL "
.It Fl h
Show program help text
.It Fl i Ar SEC
SSDP notify interval (30-900), default 300 sec
.It Fl l Ar LEVEL
Set log level to one of the following, default
.Nm notice :
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width WARNING -compact
.It Cm none
Disable all logging
.It Cm error
Error conditions
.It Cm warning
Warning conditions
.It Cm notice
Normal but significant condition (default)
.It Cm info
Informational
.It Cm debug
Debug-level messages
.El
.Pp
.It Fl n
Run in foreground, do not daemonize by default
.It Fl m Ar NAME
Override
.Cm manufacturer
in
.Pa description.xml .
.It Fl M Ar UIRL
Override
.Cm manufacturerURL
in
.Pa description.xml .
.It Fl p Ar URL
Override
.Cm presentationURL
in
.Pa description.xml .
This can be an absolute or relative URL.  The default in the built-in
micro HTTP server is to use the IP address of the interface the client
connets to,
.Lk http://IP/
.Pp
The
.Cm presentationURL
is usually the URL to access the device's web interface.
.It Fl r Ar SEC
Interface refresh interval (5-1800), default 600 sec
.It Fl s
Use syslog, default unless running in foreground,
.Fl n .
.It Fl t Ar TTL
TTL for multicast frames, default 2, according to the UPnP Device
Architecture (UDA)
.It Fl u Ar UUID
Custom UUID to use.  By default,
.Nm
generates a UUID when starting up the first time.  That UUID is
cached between restarts in the file
.Pa /var/lib/misc/ssdpd.cache .
When this option is given, the built-in UUID generator is disabled and
the cache file is not used.
.It Fl v
Show program version
.It Fl w
Disable built-in micro HTTP server on port 1901.  Use this when
you want to use another (more capable) web server to provide the
.Pa description.xml
file that clients request to read the IP address and, optionally,
custom icon for your device.  See below for an example of how the
.Pa description.xml
file can look.
.It Op Ar IFACE
By default
.Nm
runs on all IPv4 capable interfaces, except loopback.  If interface
names are given as arguments,
.Nm
will run only on them.  Interfaces are refreshed at runtime, so if
an interface given on the command line does not exist at first,
.Nm
will add them later.
.El
.Sh WEB SERVER
The built-in micro HTTP server runs on port 1901 (base SSDP port + 1).
Its only purpose is to serve the file
.Pa description.xml
that clients request after receiving the SSDP announcement frames.  The
default XML file looks like this:
.Pp
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<root xmlns="urn:schemas-upnp-org:device-1-0">
 <specVersion>
   <major>1</major>
   <minor>0</minor>
 </specVersion>
 <device>
  <deviceType>urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1</deviceType>
  <friendlyName>HOSTNAME</friendlyName>
  <manufacturer>Troglobit Software Systems</manufacturer>
  <manufacturerURL>https://troglobit.com</manufacturerURL>
  <modelName>Generic</modelName>
  <UDN>uuid:12345678-coff-eede-adbe-ff00-123456654321</UDN>
  <presentationURL>http://1.2.3.4/description.xml</presentationURL>
 </device>
</root>
.Ed
.Pp
When
.Nm
is started with the
.Fl w
option it is imperative that the
.Fl u Ar UUID
is also provided.  Otherwise clients wil detect a mismatch in the
advertised UUID and the XML file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/lib/misc/ssdpd.cache -compact
.It Pa /run/ssdpd.pid
PID file, created as soon as all setup is complete
.It Pa /etc/os-release
Linux standard base release information.  Primarily used to figure out
distribution name and release version
.It Pa /etc/lsb-release
If
.Pa /etc/os-release
does not exist,
.Nm
falls back to query this non-standard file for information on the
distribution name and release version
.It Pa /var/lib/misc/ssdpd.cache
Cached UUID (Linux), may be wiped by the system on reboot
.It Pa /var/db/ssdpd.cache
Cached UUID (*BSD), may be wiped by the system on reboot
